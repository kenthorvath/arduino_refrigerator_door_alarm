Arduino Refrigerator Door Alarm
===============================

I worked in a lab with a -20ยบ C refrigerator that would often refuse to close. 

So, I cooked up a simple timing circuit that would fire a loud pulsing alarm whenever 
the door was open for more than 60 seconds. For simplicity, I ported everything over to
Arduino. 

See the source for a parts list and further details.
